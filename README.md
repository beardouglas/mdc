# Android sample code for Mobile DevCon 2013.

This app is a simple "Resources Browser" for Facebook information. It is the standard master-detail Android app template pre-filled with content about Facebook's developer resources. The purpose of this sample is to go over how you can add Facebook Login and social features to an existing Android app.

The app currently has all Facebook functionality commented out, with the exception of including a LoginButton in the StoryListActivity view. The detail view UI has two buttons already in the layout, one labeled "Share" and the other labeled, "Who should see this?" At the beginning, they do nothing.

Over the course of the demo, we will add Facebook Login to the app; make an API call for information about the currently logged-in user; share back to Facebook using a Feed Dialog; and pop up a friend picker.

This sample, and the session, are intended as a jumping-off point for adding richer social integration and sharing back to Facebook with Open Graph. For more specific samples about Open Graph sharing, check out github.com/fbsamples
